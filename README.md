# Omega Doom

Very much in the early phases. I'm just clowning around with some shell scripting and ASCII rendering.

All copyrights go to those of the original creators and copyright holders of any material used.

I am a big scifi fan, Star Trek being one of the biggest, so if I've used any visuals, words or likeness it was not in any attempt to rip off said original creators or copyright holders. I just want to create something for fun and let my imagine run for some cathodic development for once :-)

This game is not part of the Star Trek universe or any other scifi one, its part of a new one I've created.

BIG BIG SHOUT OUT TO Christian Stigen Larsen and Christoph Raitzig for the jp2a command, without it none of the renders would have been possible!
